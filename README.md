FUSION360 EXPLAINATIONS

PART 1) 
This duck has a vibration motor, joystick, push button, and accelerometer/gyro. The accelerometer/gyro sensor will be used to attack the hunter when the game is in attack mode. The user will have to shake the controller in order to simulate attacking the hunter. The joystick will be used for moving the duck in the air from side to side in flee mode. And the push button will be used to randomly initiate attack mode or flee mode. The vibration motor will be used to give the player a rumble sensation before they are about to attack or flee for some extra immersion.

There is no accelerometer/gyroscope in tinkerCAD, so that component is left out of the schematic.
