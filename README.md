FUSION360 EXPLAINATIONS

COMPONENTS) 
This duck has a vibration motor, joystick, push button, and accelerometer/gyro. The accelerometer/gyro sensor will be used to attack the hunter when the game is in attack mode. The user will have to shake the controller in order to simulate attacking the hunter. The joystick will be used for moving the duck in the air from side to side in flee mode. And the push button will be used to randomly initiate attack mode or flee mode. The vibration motor will be used to give the player a rumble sensation before they are about to attack or flee for some extra immersion.

ASSEMBLY)
The assembly consists of two parts, a top layer and a bottom layer. The bottom layer has a hold inside of it to fit the components of the controller. The top part is a roof for the controller so the internal components are inaccessable by the player.  The controller is designed to be shaped like a duck in order to immerse the player in their role as a duck.

TINKERCAD)
In the video, it shows the push button activating a output saying "Flee/Attack mode engaged". This is supposed to represent the duck player pressing the button to activate a random mode. Next, the two potentiometers represent the X and Y axis of the joystick. This is supposed to represent the joystick being used to move the duck around the screen. Since there is no joystick in TinkerCAD, I used two potentiometers instead. Lastly, the vibration motor to represent the rumble abilities is always on for demonstration purposes.

There is no accelerometer/gyroscope in tinkerCAD, so that component is left out of the schematic. The joystick component is also not available in TinkerCAD, so it has been replaced with two potentiometers for the X and Y inputs of the joystick.
